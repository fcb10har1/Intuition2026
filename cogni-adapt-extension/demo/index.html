              You must submit your work in the required format, ensure all required fields are completed, and upload documents
              that are legible and properly formatted. Requests for extensions must be submitted at least 48 hours in advance;
              late requests may not be accepted unless supported by official documentation from student services. Ensure PDF
              files are not locked, have OCR enabled, and are under 10MB in size. All supplementary materials should be clearly
              labeled and referenced in your main submission to avoid administrative delays.

              File names must follow the format: COURSECODE_NAME_STUDENTID (e.g., CS101_SMITH_U23456789). Deviations may cause
              automated rejection or administrative delays. Refer to the FAQ for examples. Ensure you address all guiding questions,
              clearly identify your assumptions, explain implications of your results, and cite all sources using the prescribed format.
              Plagiarism detection will be applied to all submissions. Academic integrity violations will be reported to student conduct.

              allow sufficient time for file uploads and validation. The system will display a confirmation ticket upon successful
              submission; screenshot this for your records. If you encounter technical issues, contact IT support immediately with your
              student ID and submission attempt details. Do not rely on email confirmation; only the ticket number proves receipt.

        <div class="item">
          <b>Textbook Readings:</b>
          <p class="dense">
            Chapter 3 (pp. 45–72): Foundational principles of systems design. This chapter covers essential background on modular architecture, separation of concerns, and design patterns commonly used in enterprise applications. Pay special attention to sections 3.2 through 3.5, which align directly with this assignment's requirements. Additional readings available in the learning management system library. Historical context (Chapter 1) is optional but recommended for deeper understanding. Supplementary lecture slides are posted every Tuesday under the "Resources" tab.

        </div>

        <div class="item">
          <b>Recommended Videos:</b>
          <p class="dense">
            "Best Practices in Modern Development" (45 min) covers industry standards and real-world applications of concepts introduced in weeks 4–6. The instructor discusses common mistakes and pitfalls observed in professional settings. Transcripts with timestamps are available in the course wiki. Optional companion podcast explores the same material in conversational format. All videos are captioned in English, French, and Mandarin. Viewing is not required but strongly encouraged before submitting your final project to improve contextual understanding and quality of your work.

          <b>Discussion Forum & Peer Support:</b>
          <p class="dense">
            The course discussion forum is monitored by both instructors and teaching assistants. Question response time target is 24 hours on weekdays and 48 hours on weekends. The forum has several focused sub-categories to help organize conversations: "Conceptual Questions," "Technical Help," "Submission Issues," and "Off-Topic/Social." Posting guidelines require respectful language, clear question structure, and demonstration of independent effort before requesting help. Search the forum history before posting to avoid duplicate questions. Participation in the forum is tracked and contributes to class engagement grades, though not mandatory.

        <div class="faqs">
          <details>
            <summary><b>Q: What if my PDF file is locked?</b></summary>
            <p class="dense">
              A: Use a PDF editor (Adobe, Preview, or free alternatives like PDFtk) to unlock your document before uploading.
              Locked files are automatically rejected by our submission validator. Instructions for each platform are available 
              in the tech support guide. If your PDF was generated from a protected source (e.g., publisher ebook), contact IT 
              support for alternative submission formats. Processing time for format exceptions is 2–3 business days.
            </p>
          </details>

          <details>
            <summary><b>Q: Can I submit late if I have documentation?</b></summary>
            <p class="dense">
              A: Late submissions with documentation are evaluated on a case-by-case basis. Student services documentation 
              (medical, compassionate leave, etc.) must be submitted simultaneously with your request using the official form. 
              Extensions of more than 7 days require approval from the dean's office. Late penalties apply: –5% for each day late, 
              capped at –50% (zero grade if over cap). In exceptional cases, petitions can be submitted within 5 business days 
              of the deadline for grade appeals.

          <details>
            <summary><b>Q: How is plagiarism checked?</b></summary>
            <p class="dense">
              A: All submissions are scanned through Turnitin before grading. Reports are available in your "Grade & Feedback" 
              page within the portal. Similarity scores above 25% trigger manual review. Intentional plagiarism results in course 
              failure and disciplinary action per university policy. Accidental duplication (e.g., reused phrasing from provided 
              templates) is flagged but not penalized if properly cited. For clarification on specific passages, reply to your 
              instructor's feedback comments within 10 days of grade publication.

        <h2>Assessment Rubric & Grading Criteria</h2>
        <p class="dense" style="margin-bottom: 12px;">
          Your submission will be assessed across five major dimensions. Each category contributes equally to your final grade (20% each).
          Scores within each category range from "Excellent" (18–20 points) through intermediate levels to "Needs Improvement" (0–6 points).
          Feedback will be provided for every category within 10 business days of submission. Resubmission for partial credit is available 
          for categories scoring below 14 points, subject to instructor approval. See the detailed rubric below for specific expectations.
